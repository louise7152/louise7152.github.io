    <div id="brief-bio">
      <p>Hi, I'm Louise! I'm currently a second year Computer Science student at Concordia University. My hobbies consist of petting my roommate's cat and giving too little time to assignments. As for computer science, my favorite part of what I'm learning would most likely be anything but this. Very hopeful to see where this journey takes me!</p>

    <div id="professional-statement">
      <p>My goal as a computer scientist is to learn how to efficiently tackle complex problems in Software Engineering and Program/Product Management disciplines. I hope to one day solve large-scale problems through the use of technology.<br>PS: the money depicted the picture above is a symbolic representation of the main reason as to why I'm in this industry.</p>
