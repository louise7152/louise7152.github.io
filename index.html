    <div id="brief-bio">
      <p>Hi, I'm Louise! I'm currently a second year Computer Science student at Concordia University. My hobbies consist of petting my roommate's cat and giving too little time to assignments. As for computer science student, my favorite part of what I'm learning would be anything but this.</p>

    <div id="professional-statement">
      <p>My goal is to learn how to efficiently tackle complex problems in Software Engineering and Program/Product Management disciplines. I hope to one day solve large-scale problems through the use of technology. PS: The money depicted the picture above is a symbolic representation of the primary reason as to why I'm in this industry.</p>
